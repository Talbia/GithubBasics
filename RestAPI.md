## Introduction to REST API 

It is short for **Representational State Transfer - Application Programming Interface**. It works as a **Client-Server** manner. For example, you make a call from a client to a server and you get the data back over the HTTP protocol. 

It is basically a convention for building HTTP services. 

> Let's look an example: [http://vidly.com/api/customers]
> - At first, here's an address starting with **http or https** - depends on the application and its requirements. **HTTPS is used to exchange data on a secure channel, HTTP otherwise.** 
> - After that, a lot of web addresses mention **API** to expose their restful services.
> - Next, customers refer to the collection of customers in an application to expose as a resource such as customers or other endpoints. Here, Customers formatted data will display as a response.
