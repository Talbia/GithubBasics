## Introduction to REST API 

It is short for **Representational State Transfer - Application Programming Interface**

It is basically a convention for building HTTP services. 

Let's look an example: [http://vidly.com/api/customers]
- At first, here's an address starting with **http or https** - depends on the application and its requirements. **HTTPS is used to exchange data on a secure channel, HTTP otherwise.**
